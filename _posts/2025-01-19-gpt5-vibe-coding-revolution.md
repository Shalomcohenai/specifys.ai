// GPT-5 generated output:
const UserDashboard = () => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Real-time notification subscription
    const subscription = subscribeToNotifications((notification) => {
      setNotifications(prev => [...prev, notification]);
    });

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className={`dashboard ${darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'}`}>
      <header className="dashboard-header">
        <h1>Welcome, {user?.name}</h1>
        <button 
          onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}
          className="theme-toggle"
        >
          {darkMode ? '‚òÄÔ∏è' : 'üåô'}
        </button>
      </header>
      
      <main className="dashboard-content">
        <NotificationPanel notifications={notifications} />
        <UserProfile user={user} />
        <QuickActions />
      </main>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Backend API Development**:
```python
# Natural language input: "Create a RESTful API for user management with authentication, role-based access control, and audit logging"

from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

app = FastAPI(title="User Management API")
security = HTTPBearer()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@app.post("/users/", response_model=UserResponse)
async def create_user(
    user_data: UserCreate,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Create a new user with role-based access control"""
    if not current_user.has_permission("user.create"):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Insufficient permissions"
        )
    
    # Audit logging
    logger.info(f"User {current_user.id} creating new user: {user_data.email}")
    
    # Create user logic
    user = create_user_in_db(db, user_data)
