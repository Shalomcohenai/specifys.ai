```javascript
// Traditional Programming Example
class UserService {
  constructor(database, logger) {
    this.db = database;
    this.logger = logger;
  }
  
  async createUser(userData) {
    try {
      // Manual validation
      if (!userData.email || !userData.password) {
        throw new Error('Email and password required');
      }
      
      // Manual database operation
      const user = await this.db.users.create({
        email: userData.email,
        password: await bcrypt.hash(userData.password, 10),
        createdAt: new Date()
      });
      
      this.logger.info('User created', { userId: user.id });
      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error('User creation failed', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

// Vibe Coding Generated Example
const UserService = {
  async createUser(userData) {
    // AI-generated with built-in validation, error handling, and logging
    return await db.users.create({
      ...userData,
      password: await hashPassword(userData.password),
      createdAt: new Date()
    });
  }
};
