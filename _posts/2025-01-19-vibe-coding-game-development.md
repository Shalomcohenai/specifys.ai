**Capabilities**:
```csharp
// Natural language input: "Create a player character that can jump, run, and collect coins"

// AI-generated Unity script:
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private float jumpForce = 10f;
    [SerializeField] private int coinCount = 0;
    
    private Rigidbody2D rb;
    private bool isGrounded;
    
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }
    
    void Update()
    {
        HandleMovement();
        HandleJumping();
    }
    
    void HandleMovement()
    {
        float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        rb.velocity = new Vector2(horizontal * moveSpeed, rb.velocity.y);
    }
    
    void HandleJumping()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) && isGrounded)
        {
            rb.velocity = new Vector2(rb.velocity.x, jumpForce);
        }
    }
    
    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Coin"))
        {
            coinCount++;
