      createdAt: 'timestamp'
    },
    subscriptions: {
      id: 'uuid',
      userId: 'foreign_key',
      plan: 'string',
      status: 'enum',
      billingCycle: 'enum'
    }
  },
  
  // AI-generated API endpoints
  api: {
    '/api/users': {
      GET: 'listUsers',
      POST: 'createUser'
    },
    '/api/subscriptions': {
      GET: 'listSubscriptions',
      POST: 'createSubscription',
      PUT: 'updateSubscription'
    }
