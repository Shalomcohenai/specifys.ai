  <h2>The Story Behind Specifys.ai</h2>
<p>I built Specifys.ai out of personal frustration.</p>
<p>As someone who loves building and experimenting with AI tools, I tried to create an app idea using ChatGPT. But I quickly noticed a recurring problem: the AI would jump straight into coding — before it really understood the full scope of the idea.</p>
<p>It felt like building a house by immediately laying bricks without a blueprint.</p>
<p>Whenever I wanted to add new features later — like user authentication or admin roles — it felt like patchwork on top of an unstable base. The result was always messy, hard to maintain, and far from my original vision.</p>
<p>That's when I realized what was missing: a specification phase. A way to describe the vibe of the app, the user flow, the features, and the logic — before writing any code.</p>
<p>So I built Specifys.ai — a lightweight tool that asks the right questions and generates a clear, structured spec document using AI. The goal is simple: To help creators and developers start smarter, not faster.</p>
<p>Specifys is based on the principles of Vibe Coding — a mindset that prioritizes clarity, flow, and intention before code.</p>
<p>I built this tool entirely on my own using AI — no backend, no user data stored. It's designed to be fast, simple, and focused on one thing: helping you turn your idea into a clean plan you can actually build on.</p>
