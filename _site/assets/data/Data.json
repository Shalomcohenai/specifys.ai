      "content": "# Application Specification Document\n## General Information\n**Topic**: App Development\n**Platform**: Mobile (iOS and Android)\n**Suggested App Title**: PetPal\n**General Idea Summary**: PetPal is a cross-platform (iOS & Android) mobile application designed to help pet owners manage their pets’ health, schedules, and social engagement. Users create profiles for each pet, track feeding, medication, walks, vaccinations, weight logs, and browse a visually engaging health dashboard. The freemium model unlocks premium analytics on pet health trends and exclusive discounts on pet services. The app integrates GDPR-compliant data handling, offline operation with local caching, voice command support and a high-contrast mode for visually impaired users. Core modules include schedule reminders, booking integrations with vet/groomers, community forums, a photo gallery, and AI-powered insights.\n## Problem Statement\nMany pet owners struggle to keep consistent records of feeding times, medication doses, vaccination schedules, and appointment bookings. Unreliable reminders lead to missed medications or vet visits; inconsistent data storage across paper notes, calendars, and messaging apps causes data inconsistency. Visually impaired users cannot interact easily with standard UIs. PetPal addresses low engagement, latency issues in data sync, offline unavailability, and accessibility shortcomings by providing:\n- Real-time reminders with local notifications (no network dependency).\n- Local-first data models with two-way sync and conflict resolution.\n- Voice-command navigation and high-contrast UI for low-vision accessibility.\n- GDPR-compliant encryption at rest and in transit.\n## Core Features\n- **Pet Profile Management**\n  - CRUD operations on pet entities—name, breed, DOB, medical history.\n  - Support for multiple pets per user;
